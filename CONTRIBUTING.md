# Guidelines for contributing to this project

- Structure
  - Each new algorithm should go into a new directory and should contain the following files:
    - `<algorithm-name>.cpp`: Template for the algorithm
    - `example.cpp`: Usage of the algorithm to get a problem accepted on Codeforces/Codechef
    - `README.md`: List of URLs to related problems
- Merging changes to master
  - Clone this repo
  - Create a new branch on the cloned repo with the name `<algorithm-name>`
  - Commit changes to that branch
  - Create a Pull Request from that branch to the master branch of this repo.
