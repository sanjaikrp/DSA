# Data Structures and Algorithms

A collection of some implementations of data structures and algorithms, primarily for competitive programming.

## Introduction

Hello, world! This effort is directed towards making a compilation of some interesting data structures and algorithms for the community to learn, collaborate, and refer to whenever required.

In the coming months, I hope to have a variety of data structures and algorithms here.

## Features

- Implementations of common data structures
- Various algorithm implementations
- Focus on competitive programming problems
- Code examples and explanations

## Technologies Used

- Programming Languages: C++, Python, Java
- Tools: Git, GitHub

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sanjaikrp/DSA.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd DSA
    ```

## Usage

1. Browse through the directories to find the data structures and algorithms of interest.
2. Each implementation comes with a README file explaining the usage and complexity.
3. Run the code examples in your local development environment to understand their functionality.
